- KW/h: integer number of pennies stored in memory
- Kilowatt hours used is also an integer stored in memory


- The bill amount will be $5 plus the cost per kilowatt hour times the number of kilowatt hours over 1000. You can use a conditional move to set the number of hours over 1000 to 0 if the numbers of hours over 1000 is negative. Move the number of dollars into one memory location, and the number of pennies into another.


- Cost KW/h: 30 pennies
- Kilowatt hours used: 150

- If we could do floating point division, this exercise would have you compute the slope of the line segment connection 2 points. Instead zou are to store the difference in x coordinates in 1 memory location and the difference in y coordinates in another. The input points are integers stored in memory. Leave register rax with the value 1 if the line segment is vertical (infinite or undefined slope) and 0 if it s not. You should use a conditional move to set the values of rax.
